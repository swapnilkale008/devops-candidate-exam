Hi Team,

As mentioned in our previous email thread, customers experienced latency issues while uploading their new project version on March 7, 2024. Unfortunately, we have received reports of the same issue occurring again on March 25, 2024.

Could you please investigate on your end to understand why this issue has recurred? Additionally, our customer has requested logs for the mentioned times. If possible, could you provide these logs for further analysis?
